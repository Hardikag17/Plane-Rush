# Plane Rush

![PlaneRush](screenshots/plane_rush_bg_not_sharp.png)

> Plane Rush is a game based on NFTs that runs on the `POLYGON` network in the `ETHEREUM` blockchain and is powered by decentralized `Chainlink` Oracles.

<h6>Built at the Chainlink Hackathon 2021</h6>

## ü§î What is Plane Rush?

‚úîÔ∏è It is an NFT based game that runs on `POLYGON` and is powered by decentralized `Chainlink` Oracles

‚úîÔ∏è We used `Alchemy` for the RPC URL Endpoint to serve the calls to the Blockchain for data from the frontend of the DApp.

‚úîÔ∏è All the NFTs are stored using `nft.storage` which stores the NFTs on `Filecoin` and `IPFS`

## ‚¨áÔ∏è About the game

‚úîÔ∏è The game involves a pilot driving a plane moves through the accelerating obstacles coming towards him. The NFT here is the Pilot and the Plane combined. 

‚úîÔ∏è The Pilot can move in any direction(up, left, right or down) to pass through these obstacles and gets 10 points whenever he successfully moves through each one of them. The game ends whenever the Pilot hits an obstacle.

‚úîÔ∏è Every Plane has an `Airspeed` that represents how fast it can move through those obstacles. The NFTs that have higher Airspeeds will be able to perform better with respect to the obstacles as they keep accelerating forever. This is the incentive model for the users to buy the Planes with a better `Airspeed`.

‚úîÔ∏è Users will be rewarded with new Randomized characters which have a speed corresponding to the score achieved in the game with a certain amount of randomization to it whenever the user achieves a new checkpoint. The NFTs are generated in the backend and the images of these NFTs are completely Random.

‚úîÔ∏è `Chainlink` is used to bring in the NFT's metadata on-chain through its API calls. Thus, the NFTs can be dynamic and randomized just by calling a smart contract function from the frontend of the DApp

### ü§î How are the Random NFT images generated?

![PlaneRush](screenshots/image_components.png)

There are several different images for each of the 5 components and they are combined randomly to generate a Random NFT

‚úîÔ∏è Visit the [Plane-Rush-API](https://github.com/DineshBS44/RandomizeNFT) github repo https://github.com/DineshBS44/RandomizeNFT to know more about the Random Character Image generation and usage of `nft.storage` which stores the NFTs on `Filecoin` and `IPFS`

‚úîÔ∏è `ChainlinkClient` contract is used to create a Request for calling the API to get metadata for the NFT such as name, image and Airspeed. The Chainlink oracle used for making GET request from the API is [Linkriver](https://linkriver.io/)
<br>

‚úîÔ∏è The metadata for the NFT is stored in `FlieCoin` and `IPFS` using `nft.storage` using the [Plane-Rush-API](https://github.com/DineshBS44/RandomizeNFT) and it returns the IPFS Hash to the smart contract using Chainlink Oracles.

‚úîÔ∏è The DApp(Decentralized Application) which includes the Game is deployed to the `Polygon Mumbai Testnet`
‚úîÔ∏è The website also has its own NFT Marketplace for the users to buy and sell NFTs that are used to play the game.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Working Demo of our DApp

The Application's frontend is deployed to https://planerush.netlify.app/ using `Netlify`. Make sure you have Metamask installed in your browser and connect it to MATIC Mumbai Testnet using the Custom RPC option. Also, get some MATIC from the Faucet.
